# Anomaly Detection

This repository builds on the work done by Aaqib Saeed https://aqibsaeed.github.io/2016-07-17-anomaly-detection/

There is a requirements.txt listing out the packages to install. You can use that with pip to install your dependencies

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install them without the requirements file. To run this execute the command below

```python
 python anomaly_detect.py
 ```
